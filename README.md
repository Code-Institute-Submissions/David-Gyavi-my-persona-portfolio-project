### **Design Choices**

<a></a>
#### Colors

I have decided to use some colors that fit well with the strong presentation of the portfolio.
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.

![Color Palette](wireframes/color_pallet.png)

* #F8F9FA: I have decided to keep the background of the overall website white-Cultured in order give the clean look of the Site.
* #CED4DA: This color I will use as a background color for whole dashboard. 
* #6C757D: This color I will use as a background color for the logs on the dashboard in order to have a small contract versus #D9D9D9 dashboard color.
* #212121: This color that I will use for my navigation bar and buttons in order to give a bit of color to the website. This color will also be used as the overall text color.

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Materialize provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
The reason why I choose Materiaize is mainly due to the various features they offer like a datepicker, floating action button etc.

## **Wireframes**
I just used only hand drawing for my wireframes to try bring out the ecxact work I wanted.
You can as well find my wire frame below:
For the homepage I have only created 1 wireframe as the design is quite basic and looks identical on all screen sizes.

I have decided to make a flowchart for the sign-in / register proccess to completely understand each step of the process.  
This flow chart, I have just used hand drawing which you can view below:

## Deployment
### Local Deployment

I have created the Portfolio project using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code. 
Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. 
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku master" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps: (
I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod. 
You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
To clone the project: 

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.
    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/David-Gyavi/my-persona-portfolio-project.git
    ``` 

1. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [required modules](https://github.com/David-Gyavi/my-persona-portfolio-project/blob/master/requirements.txt) using the following command:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    1. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI"
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "DATABASE_NAME")
    ```

    Please note that you will need to update the **SECRET_KEY** with your own secret key, as well as the **MONGO_URI** and **MONGO_DBNAME** variables with those provided by MongoDB.
    Tip for your SECRET_KEY, you can use a [Password Generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) in order to have a secure secret key. 
    I personlly recommend a length of 24 characters and exclude Symbols.
    To find your MONGO_URI, go to your clusters and click on connect. Choose connect your application and copy the link provided. 
    Don't forget to update the necessary fields like password and database name. 

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

1. The application can now be run locally. In your terminal, type the following command 
    ```
    python3 app.py. 
    ```

### To deploy your project on Heroku, use the following steps: 

1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region. 
1. Ensure the Procfile and requirements.txt files exist are present and up-to-date in your local repository.  
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: python app.py
    ```

1. Scroll down to "deployment method"-section. Choose "Github" for automatic deployment.
1. From the inputs below, make sure your github user is selected, and then enter the name for your repo. Click "search". When it finds the repo, click the "connect" button.
1. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py (IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGODB_NAME):
    !You shouldn't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, only in your env.py to prevent DEBUG being active on live website. 

    ```
    IP = 0.0.0.0
    PORT = 5000
    SECRET_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URI
    MONGO_DBNAME = DATABASE_NAME
    ```

1. Scroll back up and click "Deploy". Scroll down and click "Enable automatic deployment".
1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes.
