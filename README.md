## **Goal for this project**

This project is all about my Portfolio, so in general am talking about my self and the skills I can render to the user or Customer.

In this portfolio you will be able to navigate with custom tuggle button through down the page and you will be able to scroll the page from the header to the footer.

### **Design Choices**

<a></a>
#### Colors

I have decided to use some colors that fit well with the strong presentation of the portfolio.
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.

![Color Palette](wireframes/color_pallet.png)

* #F8F9FA: I have decided to keep the background of the overall website white-Cultured in order give the clean look of the Site.
* #CED4DA: This color I will use as a background color for whole dashboard. 
* #6C757D: This color I will use as a background color for the logs on the dashboard in order to have a small contract versus #D9D9D9 dashboard color.
* #212121: This color that I will use for my navigation bar and buttons in order to give a bit of color to the website. This color will also be used as the overall text color.

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Materialize provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
The reason why I choose Materiaize is mainly due to the various features they offer like a datepicker, floating action button etc.

## **Wireframes**
I just used only hand drawing for my wireframes to try bring out the ecxact work I wanted.
You can as well find my wire frame below:
For the homepage I have only created 1 wireframe as the design is quite basic and looks identical on all screen sizes.

## Testing

### Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [JS validation](https://jshint.com) for each .js file/ , if using ES6, add this before pasting in your file: `/*jshint esversion: 6 */ `
- [JSON validation](https://jsonlint.com/) for each .json file 
- [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/) include a screenshot of results

Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why. IT IS BEST NOT to have ERRORS, but NINJA, COLOR VARIABLES sometimes are ok to ignore if you say the IDE that has the correct linters noted no errors. Or you can take the rendered HTML and run it through the HTML validator for the Flask html templates.

If the line is too long just add 
```$python 
# noqa
```
There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.


### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
| browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
| browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
| real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
| chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
| browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
| browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |

### Automated Testing
Whenever it is feasible, automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

If you did not run automating testing. State why you chose not to.

### Manual Testing

You can track your test in various ways.  

But for any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 

1. Markdown
>  A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
> 
>  **Register Page**
>  Go to the Register page: http://<YOUR APPP>.herokuapp.com/register
>    - [x] Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
>    - [x] Try to submit the form with an invalid username format and verify that a relevant error message appears
>    - [x] Try to submit the form with an invalid password format and verify that a relevant error message appears
>    - [x] Try to submit the form with an existing username, should re-render page with relevant error message/warning
>    - [x] Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears and user is on profile page
>    - [x] Be logged in and go to register page url http://<YOUR APPP>.herokuapp.com/register, should have error saying you are already registered and be on profile page

2. Spreadsheet    
> Here is a [Manual Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189VpSeEG9oevSRhvb2WZl8zCk9L3s2iWQyrJ_1jjAGQ/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use as a starting point to keep track of your testing efforts. Make a copy of it in your own account and update as needed to reflect the browsers you are testing and features.  

3. GitHub Issues, Milestones & Boards
> You can also use agile tools in github to help track your testing and defects. Here's a document that I put together about that [process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit?usp=sharing)

It's ok to spot check specific functionality across devices and browsers but each page should be viewed as a whole for each device/browser combo at least once.

A quick way to check if items are exceeding the screen width of a project is to run this javascript in the console for various screen emulations:

```
var docWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;
[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'),function(el){if(el.offsetWidth > docWidth){console.log(el);}});
```

### Defect Tracking

You should mention  any  bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Here is a [Defect Tracking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYB4X4wTCNEW_Y1no3hsGbclh2bLokl_I5Ev3s5EuJA/edit?usp=sharing) you use as a starting point to track defects. Make a copy of the sheet to your own account and update the Features sheet to match your project. 

Again, you could use [github issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit?usp=sharing) to track you defects. Or write them up with markdown.
 
### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.

## Deployment
### Local Deployment

I have created the Portfolio project using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code. 
Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. 
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku master" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps: (
I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod. 
You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
To clone the project: 

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.
    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/David-Gyavi/my-persona-portfolio-project.git
    ``` 

1. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [required modules](https://github.com/David-Gyavi/my-persona-portfolio-project/blob/master/requirements.txt) using the following command:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    1. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI"
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "DATABASE_NAME")
    ```

    Please note that you will need to update the **SECRET_KEY** with your own secret key, as well as the **MONGO_URI** and **MONGO_DBNAME** variables with those provided by MongoDB.
    Tip for your SECRET_KEY, you can use a [Password Generator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) in order to have a secure secret key. 
    I personlly recommend a length of 24 characters and exclude Symbols.
    To find your MONGO_URI, go to your clusters and click on connect. Choose connect your application and copy the link provided. 
    Don't forget to update the necessary fields like password and database name. 

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

1. The application can now be run locally. In your terminal, type the following command 
    ```
    python3 app.py. 
    ```

### To deploy your project on Heroku, use the following steps: 

1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region. 
1. Ensure the Procfile and requirements.txt files exist are present and up-to-date in your local repository.  
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: python app.py
    ```

1. Scroll down to "deployment method"-section. Choose "Github" for automatic deployment.
1. From the inputs below, make sure your github user is selected, and then enter the name for your repo. Click "search". When it finds the repo, click the "connect" button.
1. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py (IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGODB_NAME):
    !You shouldn't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, only in your env.py to prevent DEBUG being active on live website. 

    ```
    IP = 0.0.0.0
    PORT = 5000
    SECRET_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URI
    MONGO_DBNAME = DATABASE_NAME
    ```

1. Scroll back up and click "Deploy". Scroll down and click "Enable automatic deployment".
1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes.
